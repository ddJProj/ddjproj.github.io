## How to use an ePortfolio for the benefit of self-promotion:
  • The primary function and role that an ePortfolio would play in self promotion, is to provide my resume, details about my abilities, and showcase some of my prior work in a form that a traditional CV cannot realistically show. For technology careers, especially those that are focused on software development, it is incredibly important to be able to show potential employers that you are capable enough with various relevant technologies. The ePortfolio is a chance for self-promoting your achievements, and accomplishments within the field of technology. As mentioned on Quickstart’s article on the topic, the ePortfolio is a chance for you to showcase your technical proficiency, “Effectively showcasing your technical proficiency within your software engineering portfolio helps leave a lasting impression on potential employers,” (Winters, 2024).

## Key points that are useful towards the goal of self promotion with an ePortfolio: 
    ◦ Demonstrating your ability to solve problems,
    ◦ Talent incorporating design and user experience (UI/UX design),
    ◦ Highlighting your ability to communicate and collaborate with others,
    ◦ General documentation of what your development process looks like
  • You can also post testimonials from colleagues or references, in addition to your work related experience. I think it would be beneficial to list the technologies that I am comfortable with, as well as perhaps areas I am currently working on learning. The ePortfolio can also fill the role of showcasing various project demo's that highlight your growth in the field, and show potential employers the type of work that they can expect if they decide to hire you. To further contribute towards the goal of self-promotion, the work and writing that you put on display in your ePortfolio should present professionalism, confidence, and attention to detail.

## Methods to mitigate risks while maximizing the marketing potential of the ePortfolio:
  • The main way that I can think of to mitigate risks and maximize on marketing potential is that I will need to very carefully think about what work I put on display in my ePortfolio. The goal is to catch the attention of potential employers, and to give them an understanding of both the quality of your work, and of your character. It is important not to over-saturate your ePortfolio with unnecessary details, work/projects that are not well polished, or other information that is not directly relevant to the positions and field that you are seeking employment in. For my own ePortfolio, this will end up with works that are functional, and that will showcase my ability to deliver value in the form of a software product that meets the guidelines and requirements that were determined during the planning stages of the project.

## Possible downsides or risks of posting intellectual property online for public consumption:
  • The primary downsides that come to mind when I think of the risks of posting intellectual property would be either that you have posted an innovative idea that someone then can take and make money off of, or that the work that you showcase is poorly designed / implemented. The reason that the first would be a downside is mainly limited to how well you are able to monetize a software product, versus how well someone else may be able to monetize a similar product. When it comes to this aspect of software design, it may very well be the case that you are not in the position, or do not have the backing that may be needed in order to grow a software product, and that by posting your intellectual property, you are taking the very real chance that others may attempt to build on, and gain from your idea base. The other downside is that you are putting your work out into the public, for the world to see, and if you have not spent the time necessary to polish your project / ideas in a positive manner, you run the risk of looking like you don't know what you're doing, or that you are careless / sloppy. My own biggest concern would be that the work that I published was not up to whatever relevant standards for the areas of software engineering that I would like to focus on. And in a case such as this, it is incredibly important to spend the time necessary to ensure that the work you put on display is well thought out, and carefully polished.
